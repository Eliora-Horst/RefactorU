Node: JS runtime environment

Difference between node.js and browswer js: 
	No window (command line interface)
	No DOM

	Modules
	File system access
	Networking access
	Hardware access

	Web server

Running a script is like running a function; the script itself can have arguments
Access command-line args with "process.argv"
	process.argv[0] = 'node'
	process.argv[1] = script
	process.argv[2 +] = args

Share code between files with 'module.exports' and 'require()'
	require returns value of parameter

fs is a core modules

npm install <package-name> : adds module to node_modules folder

When requiring installed modules, you don't need to use a filepath.  Node looks for modules in node_module folder

--save : adds to package.json

patch/fix: fixes bug, doesn't change how module is use
minor/feature: new function, old code still in place
major/fail: breaking changes


DNS (domain name server) : reach out to DNS, DNS returns IP address of website
	Send request to port 80
	The server will read the request
	Server determines who is requesting, what they want etc
	Returns a response packet
